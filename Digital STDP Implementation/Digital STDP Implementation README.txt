PREFACE: All HDL files provided are targeted for the DE1-SOC development board. All reported hardware utilization numbers for our current works have been obtained from re-synthesizing our original HDL designs using the Xilinx ISE Design Suite in order to provide a direct comparison to previous works. These files are provided as is- reminants of Verilog logic used to interface with our UART communication scheme have not been removed from the following publically avaliable files:

PSTDP.v: Paired Based Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Verilog Implementation
TSTDP.v: Full Triplet Based Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Verilog Implementation
TMH.v: TSTDP Hippocampal Verilog Implementation
TMVC.v: Minimal TSTDP Visual Cortex Implementation
